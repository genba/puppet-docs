##Important Setup Information

+ Razor has been specifically tested in the following setups/environments: RHEL/CentOS 6.4 
+ The Razor microkernel is 64-bit only. Razor can only provision 64-bit machines.
+ Razor has a minimum hardware requirement of 512MB of RAM. 

####Using Razor
The repo contains the actual bits that are used when installing a node; the installation instructions are contained in tasks. Razor comes with a few predefined tasks to get you started. They can be found in the tasks/ directory in the razor-server repo, and they can all be used by simply mentioning their name in a policy. This includes the `vmware_esxi` installer.

##Known Issues

###Razor doesn't handle local time jumps 
The Razor server is sensitive to large jumps in the local time, like the one that is experienced by a VM after it has been suspended for some time and then resumed. In that case, the server will stop processing background tasks, such as the creation of repos. To remediate that, restart the server by issuing the command, `service pe-razor-server restart`.

###JSON warning
When you run Razor commands, you might get this warning: "MultiJson is using the default adapter (ok_json). We recommend loading a different JSON library to improve performance."

This situation is completely harmless. However, if you're using Ruby 1.8.7, you can install a separate JSON library, such as json_pure, to make the warning go away.

###Razor hangs in VirtualBox 4.3.6
We're finding that VirtualBox 4.3.6 gets to the point of downloading the microkernel from the Razor server and hangs at 0% indefinitely. We don't have this problem with VirtualBox 4.2.22. 

###Using Razor on Windows
Windows support is **ALPHA** quality. The purpose of the current Windows installer is to get real world experience with Windows installation automation, and to discover the missing features required to truly support the Windows world. 

###Temp files aren't removed as soon as you might expect
This is due to Ruby code working as designed, and while it takes longer to remove temporary files than you might expect, the files are removed when the object is finalized.

###The "no_replace" parameter is ignored for the "update-node-metadata" command
This parameter is not currently working.

###Confusing POST error message
If you provide an empty string to the "--iso-url" parameter for the "create-repo" command, the Razor client return a confusing error message:

	Error from doing POST http://rg-razor.delivery.puppetlabs.net:8080/api/commands/create-repo
	400 Bad Request
	urls only one of url and iso_url can be used

The error intends to indicate that you cannot supply both those attributes at the same time on a single repo instance.
